Some scripts for visualizing the randomness of bit strings of fixed length.

## Usage:
	`$./randomness_examples.py rand`
will generate a distribution plot of cumulative sums as well as well as the
transition probabilities from every nth to every (n+1)th bit.
	`$./ranomness_examples.py heatmap`
will generated a heatmap of the bit strings turned into random walks in a galton board.
